i've been meaning to start this for a while.  
this blog is where i'll share:

- what i'm learning (tech, startups, design, marketing… basically my rabbit holes)  
- what i'm building (side projects, experiments, half-finished ideas)  
- code snippets
- tutorials (yea, maybe)
- thoughts that don’t fit in a tweet or LinkedIn post

right now, i'm:  
- expanding my stack into Web3  
- still shipping projects in Web2 (React, Node, etc.)  
- exploring ideas in SaaS and product-building  

i don't know how consistent this will be, but i wanted a place that's mine outside social feeds... most of my posts on twitter gets burried after a few more posts

This is my twitter btw: x.com/piyushkkr
