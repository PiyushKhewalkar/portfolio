I’ve been meaning to start this for a while.  
This blog is where I’ll share:

- What I’m learning (tech, startups, design, marketing… basically my rabbit holes)  
- What I’m building (side projects, experiments, half-finished ideas)  
- Code snippets
- Tutorials (yea, maybe)
- Thoughts that don’t fit in a tweet or LinkedIn post  

Right now, I’m:  
- Expanding my stack into Web3  
- Still shipping projects in Web2 (React, Node, etc.)  
- Exploring ideas in SaaS and product-building  

I don’t know how consistent this will be, but I wanted a place that’s mine outside social feeds... Most of my posts on twitter gets burried after a few more posts
